no more hub -- wm and xec and whatnot will have their own signals

actions SHOULD optionally know about what methods they want to attach to what
signals.  you just construct them and pass them a few things and they set
themselves up.  this will clean up config a lot.  actions that you might want
to reconfigure (bindings, focus model, etc) should not do this -- only actions
that can only conceivably work one way.
