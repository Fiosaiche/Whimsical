to implement viewports:

    - set _NET_DESKTOP_GEOMETRY prop on root
        - set width/height of large desktop
        - also handle client messages of this type, from pagers

    - set _NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT prop on root
        - [[x, y], ...] - origin of current viewport for each desktop
        - also handle client messages of this type, from pagers

to implement ewmh (bare minimum):

    - set _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK prop on root
        - create child window for this, with prop also set on it
        - child window should have _NET_WM_NAME set to name of wm
        - ---- COMPLETE ----

    - set _NET_SUPPORTED prop on root
        - lists supported ewmh atoms (not just keys but also values)
        - independently read/append/write this list for code to not be
          interdependent
        - ---- COMPLETE ---- (props.append_to_net_supported())

ewmh stuff to implement (phase one):

    - maintain _NET_CLIENT_LIST prop on root
        - lists all managed windows, initial mapping order, oldest first

    - maintain _NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKINg prop on root
        - lists all managed windows in stacking order, bottom first

    - maintain _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW prop on root

ewmh stuff to implement (phase two):
    - _NET_CLOSE_WINDOW
    - _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW
    - _NET_RESTACK_WINDOW
    - _NET_WM_NAME
    - _NET_WM_VISIBLE_NAME
    - _NET_WM_PID
    - _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS
    - _NET_WM_PING
    - transient stuff (icccm & ewmh)
