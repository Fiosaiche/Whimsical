on key/button grabbing & selecting for events:

    - having to pre-grab keys at startup makes things more cumbersome and makes
      dynamic bindings more troublesome

    - you can grab for all key/button combos and then selectively replay them:

        - you must correctly replay or "swallow" all of the key/button events
          with XAllowEvents.  i believe there is only one way to do that and it
          was a pain in the ass to figure out, but it works

        - select {Key,Button}{Press,Release}Mask on root but not on client
          windows

        - use XGrab{Key,Button} on client windows with Any{Key,Button} and
          AnyModifier

    - since we grab all button presses/releases, we get EnterNotify events
      every time one happens.  if you only want to check for "normal"
      EnterNotifys (not ones caused by clicks), then check that
      (not ev.state & (X.Button1Mask|X.Button2Mask|...|X.Button5Mask))
