#IDEA!!
# have the wm have 'states' or 'scenes' (in game terms)
# this would allow for clean move/resize loops
# have some handlers that persist in all new scenes (just a boolean called 'persist'?)

# perhaps somehow split actions up into <which window(s)> and <what to do
# to it/them>

# perhaps clean up variations between functions and callable instances -- the
# randomness of parentheses is confusing
